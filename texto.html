        <i>nature</i>.
        <i>New Scientist</i>. and all the other scientiffic journals her work had appeared in. was a well thumbed copy
        of <cite>On the road</cite>. It had been molly favorrite book since college. and the longer she spent in these
        four walls the more she felt she needed to be free

    <p>she had spent the last ten years in thhis room. sitting under a poster with an oscar wilde quote proclaiming that
        <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work.
        unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>.. to be an outstanding
